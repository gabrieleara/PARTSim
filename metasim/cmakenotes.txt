# # Actually to export the "include" directory we need to copy manually files
# install(DIRECTORY include/ DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR})
# install(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/librdtsc DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR})

# # This exports a CMake file that allows the project to be imported
# # into other CMake projects from the install directory.
# # The directory in which the file will be installed is a per-project
# # directory in this case, otherwise use common cmake directory
# install(EXPORT librdtsc-config DESTINATION share/rdtsc/cmake)

# # This makes the project importable from the build directory
# export(TARGETS rdtsc FILE librdtsc-config.cmake)

# # Any CMake project that needs to use FORB library can simply import all
# # its settings by using the following command within CMakeLists.txt:
# #
# #   find_package(librdtsc)

# # Export.
# export (TARGETS ${PROJECT_NAME} FILE "./metasimConfig.cmake")
# export (PACKAGE ${PROJECT_NAME})
